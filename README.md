## Types and Libraries
- Rust has a number of types named Result in its standard library
- The Result types are enumerations, often referred to as enums.
- An enumeration is a type that can have a fixed set of values,called the enumâ€™s variants.
- The purpose of these Result types is to encode error-handling information.
- An instance of io::Result has an expect method that you can call. 
- We can think of {} as little crab pincers that hold a value in place.
